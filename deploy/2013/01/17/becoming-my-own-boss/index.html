                    <p>
                        <p>This past July I decided to take the startup plunge again. I quit my job at a big bank and joined a startup that I had been working closely with since last February. I had a great time, and was lucky enough to help raise a $1.5 million round. We had a long way to go, but it felt like we were onto something. Unfortunately, there were some disagreements between some of us co-founders. A fellow co-founder and I ended up leaving the company. I learned so much during the experience, which I will definitely share in a later post, but I was left in a very awkward situation. I was happy to no longer be in Corporate America, but compensation during my 5 months of full time work at the startup was basically nothing, and I had dug myself a bit of a hole financially. The situation led to a decent amount of anxiety, and a lot of soul searching. I realized I was fed up with buying into other's ideas. I no longer wanted equity to compensate for a lower salary. I decided I wasn't going to be tied down to one person and company, and be expected to put in 80 hour weeks because "that's just what you do in a start up." I decided I'd pay the bills doing as little freelance as possible, and devote all other time to my ideas. Ultimately, I've started believing in myself and my ability to make a product people want. The following are lessons I've learned while being my own boss for about 3 months now. </p>
<p><strong>Finding Work</strong></p>
<p>Be connected in the tech community. This makes the process of finding work very easy. I don't mean being the dbag at "networking" events, whoring out your business cards. Rather, go to meetups, and tech events to meet the other people in the community. I never went selling myself in the past, I just loved meeting smart people. When these people found out I was available for work, the requests for hire came to me. This is also incredibly important because this is where you can bounce your own ideas off people, and find your initial customers for any product you end up building. </p>
<p><strong>Don't Sell Yourself Short</strong></p>
<p>I started out at a rate I thought was fair, and for every new client I've significantly increased that rate. To my surprise, no one has negotiated lower rates and at this point, just 3 months after starting, I've doubled my initial rate (meaning I've now split the amount of time I have to work for others in half). Keep increasing rates until you're declined, you'll be surprised at what you're worth.</p>
<p><strong>Make the Most Of Your Free Time</strong></p>
<p>I only work enough to pay my bills, which leaves me with a lot more time to work on my own stuff. More importantly, though, I have time to try new things. This is what excites me the most about my new found 'career' as a freelance dev. I used to feel like there wasn't enough time in the day. Now I have a hard time deciding how I can fill my day with activities that don't require me to sit behind a monitor. I really try to do more than just code all day. To my surprise, looking at my commits lately, I actually accomplish a lot more in far less amount of time. Not having time limits allows you to truly get in the zone when you have to.</p>
<p><strong>Travel</strong></p>
<p>This year I'm going to make the most out of being able to work wherever. I'm really excited for PyCon, DjangoCon (both US and Europe), Waza, and more. Having a full time job really limits your ability to go where you want, when you want. Now I can go wherever and not have to worry about how many more vacation days I have remaining for the year, which I constantly struggled with in Corp America.</p>
<p><strong>Do Something Different</strong></p>
<p>I decided to do something different to keep life interesting. I have an apartment in Pittsburgh, but I've always wished I was a little closer to my family. I decided to be co-located between Pittsburgh and Syracuse. I found a really cheap place 'in the middle of nowhere.' It is beautiful and distraction free; truly a great place to get stuff done. When I need to clear my mind, the beautiful wilderness is right there to take an awesome hike in. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I never thought I could be my own boss. The lack of structure and the securities of a 9-5 always kept me from even considering. I couldn't be happier that an unfortunate situation forced me to give it a shot. I haven't been this happy with myself and my work in a long time. I actually feel like I accomplish something every day, and don't come home with office horror stories and stress.</p>
