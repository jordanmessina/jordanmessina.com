                    <p>
                        <p>I was faced with a problem last Sunday, like many football fans usually are,
of not being able to watch the game that I really care about. Rather, I have
to watch what the CBS and Fox stations in my area decide are the games that
appeal to the general mass of viewers. The thing I find crazy is the fact that
the NFL fails to please their entire viewership by not leveraging the Internet
when it comes to sports. But when it comes to television shows, the
broadcasting companies are finally understanding how to please people. Look at
the success there has been with streaming shows directly from the
broadcaster’s websites, streaming the shows right from Hulu, and all the other
means of show streaming that are legal now. Why haven’t more content providers
done this for sports? I know ESPN has ESPN360, but this doesn’t provide every
game that ESPN plays on television, and it is also only available for people
using an ISP that has signed up for it. So ESPN is ALMOST there, but not
quite. As I sit here watching one football game that is being streamed
illegally on Justin.tv, and watching another one simultaneously on television,
I realized I’m exposed to twice as many advertisements. The illegal stream is
doing more good for the broadcasting company than bad. I find it crazy that
the NFL wouldn’t cut a deal with Fox and CBS to allow the games to be streamed
legally. I’m not the most business savvy person by any means, but I feel like
less than 1% of NFL fans will buy an NFL package from their cable provider
that allows them to watch any game they want, while over 30% (literarlly making
percentages up) would watch a game streaming legally on cbs.com. Since it’s all 
about money (although it should be about caring for the fans that really make the NFL
the sport it is) you tell me which deal would be more profitable for the NFL? I know
there are many aspects of the business I’m completely ignorant to, and there
are probably plenty of reasons why this isn’t possible, but considering it’s
2009 and they are losing money from illegal streaming, they might as well make
everyone happy and make some money at the same time. I’m going to get back to
watching my illegal stream, where everyone is benefiting BUT the NFL.</p>
