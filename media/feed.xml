You just learn to program, or better yet, just get one of those mythical creatures they call a technical co-founder, and build stuff. Type in 'heroku create' and boom, you've got a startup. And if you&#8217;re lucky, you have the chance of getting some &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/09/instagram-facebook-acquisition_n_1412623.html"&gt;phat&lt;/a&gt; stacks. Startups have become the new age casino game, easy to play and great payouts for the lucky ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many, it really is just a gamble; you roll the dice and accept it when you fail. Maybe you have a great team of hackers. You follow the lean startup methodology. You ship early, you ship often. You do all the things startups are suppose to do. So when it fails, you feel like it&#8217;s not your fault, you were just unlucky this time. You can always play again. It&#8217;s startup roulette, where failing is expected and accepted. However, this gambling mentality turns out to be the cause for so many failed startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Consequences of Gambling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that most startups fail because there&#8217;s only room for a finite amount of winners is a fallacy. The truth is, most startups fail because they&#8217;re treated like a gamble and failure is expected. Calling a company a startup makes it easier for founders to accept failure, It&#8217;s a safety net. They didn't fail, their startup did. They&#8217;re encouraged to just gamble again. Most founders are looking for the easy road to hitting the jackpot. When they don&#8217;t find it with one idea, they move on to the next. They make a little more progress this time, not making the same mistakes, but when times get tough, they do what&#8217;s easiest: give up. On to the next idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where is the fight?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If every founder had perseverance like the &lt;a href="http://startupschool.org/2012/rusenko/"&gt;Weebly&lt;/a&gt; founders, I think there&#8217;d be so many more winners. If there was a real consequence for failing, founders wouldn&#8217;t give up so easily. Founders would &lt;a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/03/airbnb.html"&gt;get creative&lt;/a&gt;, they'd fight to win more. Instead, most failed founders avoid humiliation by not taking personal responsibility. They deflect those feelings toward the startup. They stop fighting for their company as soon as it gets really hard. They&#8217;d rather take a nice salary at Google than tough it out for something they once believed in, and that&#8217;s a shame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Overlooked Characteristic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founders with the best chance of succeeding are the ones that are smart, creative, and hardworking. You&#8217;ll discover these characteristics from a simple conversation, but these aren&#8217;t enough. You also need &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=j4k7UebvnFU#t=1069s"&gt;courage&lt;/a&gt;, and this is march harder to to come by. Founders with courage make no excuses. Failure isn&#8217;t an option. It is not acceptable. These founders will be successful because they&#8217;re focusing on building a real company while everyone else is losing at startup roulette.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://jordanmessina.com/2013/02/08/startup-roulette</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Becoming My Own Boss</title><link>http://jordanmessina.com/2013/01/17/becoming-my-own-boss</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This past July I decided to take the startup plunge again. I quit my job at a big bank and joined a startup that I had been working closely with since last February. I had a great time, and was lucky enough to help raise a $1.5 million round. We had a long way to go, but it felt like we were onto something. Unfortunately, there were some disagreements between some of us co-founders. A fellow co-founder and I ended up leaving the company. I learned so much during the experience, which I will definitely share in a later post, but I was left in a very awkward situation. I was happy to no longer be in Corporate America, but compensation during my 5 months of full time work at the startup was basically nothing, and I had dug myself a bit of a hole financially. The situation led to a decent amount of anxiety, and a lot of soul searching. I realized I was fed up with buying into other's ideas. I no longer wanted equity to compensate for a lower salary. I decided I wasn't going to be tied down to one person and company, and be expected to put in 80 hour weeks because "that's just what you do in a start up." I decided I'd pay the bills doing as little freelance as possible, and devote all other time to my ideas. Ultimately, I've started believing in myself and my ability to make a product people want. The following are lessons I've learned while being my own boss for about 3 months now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be connected in the tech community. This makes the process of finding work very easy. I don't mean being the dbag at "networking" events, whoring out your business cards. Rather, go to meetups, and tech events to meet the other people in the community. I never went selling myself in the past, I just loved meeting smart people. When these people found out I was available for work, the requests for hire came to me. This is also incredibly important because this is where you can bounce your own ideas off people, and find your initial customers for any product you end up building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't Sell Yourself Short&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out at a rate I thought was fair, and for every new client I've significantly increased that rate. To my surprise, no one has negotiated lower rates and at this point, just 3 months after starting, I've doubled my initial rate (meaning I've now split the amount of time I have to work for others in half). Keep increasing rates until you're declined, you'll be surprised at what you're worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make the Most Of Your Free Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only work enough to pay my bills, which leaves me with a lot more time to work on my own stuff. More importantly, though, I have time to try new things. This is what excites me the most about my new found 'career' as a freelance dev. I used to feel like there wasn't enough time in the day. Now I have a hard time deciding how I can fill my day with activities that don't require me to sit behind a monitor. I really try to do more than just code all day. To my surprise, looking at my commits lately, I actually accomplish a lot more in far less amount of time. Not having time limits allows you to truly get in the zone when you have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I'm going to make the most out of being able to work wherever. I'm really excited for PyCon, DjangoCon (both US and Europe), Waza, and more. Having a full time job really limits your ability to go where you want, when you want. Now I can go wherever and not have to worry about how many more vacation days I have remaining for the year, which I constantly struggled with in Corp America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do Something Different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to do something different to keep life interesting. I have an apartment in Pittsburgh, but I've always wished I was a little closer to my family. I decided to be co-located between Pittsburgh and Syracuse. I found a really cheap place 'in the middle of nowhere.' It is beautiful and distraction free; truly a great place to get stuff done. When I need to clear my mind, the beautiful wilderness is right there to take an awesome hike in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="In the middle of nowhere" src="/img/granary.jpg" title="In the middle of nowhere" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never thought I could be my own boss. The lack of structure and the securities of a 9-5 always kept me from even considering. I couldn't be happier that an unfortunate situation forced me to give it a shot. I haven't been this happy with myself and my work in a long time. I actually feel like I accomplish something every day, and don't come home with office horror stories and stress.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://jordanmessina.com/2013/01/17/becoming-my-own-boss</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Install Any App on the Kindle Fire</title><link>http://jordanmessina.com/2011/11/15/install-any-app-on-the-kindle-fire</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick video I made showing how to install Easy Installer and install

had just kept up with a few projects that I had started in the past, I'd
probably have some mild success and traction with at least one of them by now.
I just finished up Rework by 37signals and I think I got the most out of the
very last page of the book from the essay about Inspiration. Inspiration is
perishable, when you have it you work your ass off nonstop until you literally
can't work anymore. It's an amazing feeling and such a high to be working on
something that you truly believe can change the world. As my roommate says,
it's 20 hours of work for 10 minutes of fun and that's what all my past
projects have seemed to end as, only 10 minutes of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I realized the problem is that once the inspiration goes away, and it
always seems to run out at some point, I end with this 'meh' feeling and
things just aren't as fun as they used to be. It sucks to admit this happens,
and I'm writing this blog post to help myself from making lies in believing
that I'm still pumped about things I've started earlier and convincing myself
that I'm just too busy at the moment to put time into it. Instead, I need to
just suck it up and get back to work on things that I've started until they're
finished. If I was excited enough at one point to put so much work into it, I
might as well complete it and stick to it so that it at least has a shot. My
goal with any project of mine is to just have people use it and appreciate it,
not to make millions and cash out quick. So quitting is obviously the worst
thing I can do, but also the easiest thing to do because I can always make
excuses as to why it would never have worked anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the past projects I've quit include a web app directory in 2007 that I
didn't see a market for after it was all built and complete. It was also
designed terribly, code wise, so changes took far too long, never try to roll
your own framework if you really don't know what you're doing. Now I see about
5 or 6 clones that all have a decent user base and I think how that could have
been me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had a podcast with two friends that was running for about a month back
in 2008. We had about 10 listeners by episode 5 but since we were expecting
overnight success, and didn't get it, we decided that we just didn't have the
time to continue working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I created a Craigslist alert app which, after spamming twitter quite
a bit, ended up with about 100 happy users. I saw some opportunity to make it
even better so I started from scratch and started developing what I would
describe now as Notifo + Twilio + other cool features. Neither of these
services existed at the time, and I had a family friend who is an amazing web
designer on board for equity to help out. I had some personal issues that set
me back about 6 months and by the time I came around I saw too many
competitors in the space and decided to stop development and not even give it
a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After thinking last night about all these things, I ended up being a little
disappointed with myself, so here I am writing a blog post to make sure I
never make these mistakes again. The point of me telling you? I'm hoping you 
keep me in check. If I say I have a project to share with you, hound me until I 
actually release it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://jordanmessina.com/2010/08/20/im-calling-myself-out</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Django - Allow users to log in using email rather than username</title><link>http://jordanmessina.com/2010/06/12/django-allow-users-to-log-in-using-email-rather-than-username</link><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the annoying things about Django is that it doesn't allow logins via
email out of the box if you're using their built-in user authentication . You
must create your own authentication backend in order to accomplish this.
However, one of the things I love about Django is the ability to create
authentication backends without too much of a headache. This comes in handy
when dealing with things like allowing users to log in via Twitter, Facebook
Connect, any OpenID providers, or allowing them to login via email and
password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django authentication backends are quite simple, essentially whenever you call
the &lt;code&gt;django.contrib.auth.authenticate()&lt;/code&gt; function, Django uses the
authenticate method in any of the classes specified by the
&lt;code&gt;AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS&lt;/code&gt; tuple set in your settings.py. If one of the classes
fails to authenticate the user, Django moves on to the next one until either
one successfully returns a user object or there are no other backends to
attempt, in which case it results in a failed login. A very simple
authentication backend which allows users to login via email rather than
username is the following code in backends.py:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;from django.conf import settings 
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class EmailModelBackend(object): 
    def authenticate(self, username=None, password=None): 
        try: 
            user = User.objects.get(email=username)
            if user.check_password(password): 
                return user 
        except User.DoesNotExist: 
            return None

    def get_user(self, user_id): 
        try: 
            return User.objects.get(pk=user_id)
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            return None
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you simply need to add to your settings.py: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    'path.to.this.backends.EmailModelBackend',
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend', 
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generally place my backends in whatever app I create to store extra user
info, but you can put it anywhere, just make sure it's in your PYTHONPATH.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://jordanmessina.com/2010/06/12/django-allow-users-to-log-in-using-email-rather-than-username</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jun 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Django 1.2 - CSRF verification failed. Request aborted.</title><link>http://jordanmessina.com/2010/05/24/django-1-2-csrf-verification-failed</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I was getting this 403 error today while attempting to make a POST request to
a view: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;403 Forbidden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSRF verification failed. Request aborted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help Reason given for failure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSRF cookie not set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 10/29/2010&lt;/strong&gt;
I've modified this post to only contain the proper way of resolving the issue. You can read about Cross Site Request Forgeries &lt;a href="http://www.squarefree.com/securitytips/web-developers.html#CSRF"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and Django's protection mechanisms &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/csrf/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve the 403 issue, you want to add the csrf_token template tag within your form somewhere. This adds a hidden div with the value of the input as the csrf token:
&lt;code&gt;html anything.html
&amp;lt;form action="..." method="POST"&amp;gt;
    {% csrf_token %}
    ...
&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to not protect against CSRF with Django's built in mechanisms, use the csrf_exempt decorator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;python views.py
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt 
... 
@csrf_exempt 
def my_func(request):
    ...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://jordanmessina.com/2010/05/24/django-1-2-csrf-verification-failed</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Illegal Streaming</title><link>http://jordanmessina.com/2009/10/11/illegal-streaming</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I was faced with a problem last Sunday, like many football fans usually are,
of not being able to watch the game that I really care about. Rather, I have
to watch what the CBS and Fox stations in my area decide are the games that
appeal to the general mass of viewers. The thing I find crazy is the fact that
the NFL fails to please their entire viewership by not leveraging the Internet
when it comes to sports. But when it comes to television shows, the
broadcasting companies are finally understanding how to please people. Look at
the success there has been with streaming shows directly from the
broadcaster&#8217;s websites, streaming the shows right from Hulu, and all the other
means of show streaming that are legal now. Why haven&#8217;t more content providers
done this for sports? I know ESPN has ESPN360, but this doesn&#8217;t provide every
game that ESPN plays on television, and it is also only available for people
using an ISP that has signed up for it. So ESPN is ALMOST there, but not
quite. As I sit here watching one football game that is being streamed
illegally on Justin.tv, and watching another one simultaneously on television,
I realized I&#8217;m exposed to twice as many advertisements. The illegal stream is
doing more good for the broadcasting company than bad. I find it crazy that
the NFL wouldn&#8217;t cut a deal with Fox and CBS to allow the games to be streamed
legally. I&#8217;m not the most business savvy person by any means, but I feel like
less than 1% of NFL fans will buy an NFL package from their cable provider
that allows them to watch any game they want, while over 30% (literarlly making
percentages up) would watch a game streaming legally on cbs.com. Since it&#8217;s all 
about money (although it should be about caring for the fans that really make the NFL
the sport it is) you tell me which deal would be more profitable for the NFL? I know
there are many aspects of the business I&#8217;m completely ignorant to, and there
are probably plenty of reasons why this isn&#8217;t possible, but considering it&#8217;s
2009 and they are losing money from illegal streaming, they might as well make
everyone happy and make some money at the same time. I&#8217;m going to get back to
watching my illegal stream, where everyone is benefiting BUT the NFL.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://jordanmessina.com/2009/10/11/illegal-streaming</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>OLPC Project Could Help More Than Just The Children</title><link>http://jordanmessina.com/2008/05/13/olpc-project-could-help-more-than-just-the-children</link><description>&lt;p&gt;According to stats posted by the &lt;a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/"&gt;Miniwatts Marketing Group&lt;/a&gt; and the annual &lt;a href="http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=229&amp;amp;Itemid=366"&gt;Failed State Index&lt;/a&gt;, 
it appears that the OLPC project could help more than just the unprivileged 
children who receive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Failed State Index gives each country a score off 1-10 based on 12
indicators. The higher the index score, the more unstable the country is.
Comparing the index score to the penetration rate of internet usage based on
population yields interesting results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://jordanmessina.com/images/2008-05-13-olpc-project-could-help-more-than-just-the-children/graph1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One potential argument could be that the states(countries) with low index
scores are most likely states with poor economies, which would obviously
effect the number of people who could even afford internet in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test if the trend of increasing stability exists when countries with
similar economies are compared, a similar chart is created using countries
with I-5 indicator scores below 6. This indicator of the Failed State Index
gives a score based on uneven economic development along group lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing countries only with economies promising enough to sustain the
costs of the infrastructures needed for internet, we get a better picture of
how the internet truly effects ones stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://jordanmessina.com/images/2008-05-13-olpc-project-could-help-more-than-just-the-children/graph2.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the upward trend still exists with countries with similar economies. 
Efforts by groups like the OLPC Association could end up affecting more than just 
the children the project aspired to help in the first place. Maybe some foreign aid 
should go towards building the infrastructures needed to get these failing states
wired so they can stop relying on their corrupt or incapable governments and help 
solve critical issues themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, our foreign aid policy has proven not to work well in the first
place, so we might as well try something new. I'm aware by simply wiring a
country and allowing the citizens to have access to computers and the Internet
isn't going to magically increase their stability, but it would definitely
help them in so many ways. Just think how much these technologies help us
everyday and where we'd be without them. To say that this couldn't help a
failing state pick itself off the ground would be absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
