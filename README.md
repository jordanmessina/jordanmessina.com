This is my blog. I used to use Octopress, but I can't stand ruby, or learning an entire blogging framework when I already know an awesome web framework (Django). I created [SerpentPress](https://github.com/jordanmessina/serpentpress) and some Markdown tools so I could continue to just use static files, and Markdown to write posts, but do all the fun stuff with Python/Django. Holla.
